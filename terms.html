<h1>Terms of Use for Review</h1>

<h2>Terms</h2>

By using Review(the "App"), you are agreeing to be bound by these terms of use, all applicable laws and regulations, and agree that you are responsible for compliance with any applicable local laws. If you do not agree with any of these terms, you are prohibited from using the App. The materials contained in this App are protected by applicable copyright and trademark law.
Apps is licensed only for non-commercial use for your internal business purposes. Non-commercial use means that you may not sell, rent, or lease the output of the Software.

<h2>Use License</h2>

Permission is granted to temporarily download one copy of the materials (information or software) on the Apps' website for personal, non-commercial transitory viewing only. This is the grant of a license, not a transfer of title, and under this license you may not:
<ul>
<li>modify or copy the materials;</li>
<li>use the materials for any commercial purpose, or for any public display (commercial or non-commercial);</li>
<li>attempt to decompile or reverse engineer any software contained on the Apps' website; remove any copyright or other proprietary notations from the materials; or transfer the materials to another person or "mirror" the materials on any other server.</li>
</ul>
This license shall automatically terminate if you violate any of these restrictions and may be terminated by App at any time. Upon terminating your viewing of these materials or upon the termination of this license, you must destroy any downloaded materials in your possession whether in electronic or printed format.

<h2>Disclaimer</h2>

The Apps shall have no liability for conduct in relation to your use of the App. You may not use the App unless you are the copyright holder or you have obtained all necessary rights and licenses to use all images and other material that make up your creation on or via the App. The materials on Apps' website are provided on an 'as is' basis.  Apps makes no warranties, expressed or implied, and hereby disclaims and negates all other warranties including, without limitation, implied warranties or conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement of intellectual property or other violation of rights.
Further, the Apps does not warrant or make any representations concerning the accuracy, likely results, or reliability of the use of the materials on its website or otherwise relating to such materials or on any sites linked to this site.

<h2>Limitations</h2>

In no event shall the Apps or its suppliers be liable for any damages (including, without limitation, damages for loss of data or profit, or due to business interruption) arising out of the use or inability to use the App and the materials on the Apps' website, even if the Apps or a the Apps authorized representative has been notified orally or in writing of the possibility of such damage.
Because some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties, or limitations of liability for consequential or incidental damages, these limitations may not apply to you.

<h2>Accuracy of materials</h2>

The materials appearing on the Apps' website and the App could include technical, typographical, or photographic errors. The Apps does not warrant that any of the materials on its website are accurate, complete or current. The Apps may make changes to the materials contained on its website at any time without notice. However the Apps does not make any commitment to update the materials.

<h2>Modifications</h2>

The App may revise these terms of use for its website and the App at any time without notice. By using this website and the App you are agreeing to be bound by the then current version of these terms of use.
